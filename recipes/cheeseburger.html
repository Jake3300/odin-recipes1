    <h2>About this recipe</h2>
        <p>This recipe is for a classic, diner-style burger with all my favorite toppings. Adding a mustard layer to the beef before frying creates the most insanely delicious crust - you'll be an immediate convert.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground chuck (80% lean)</li>
        <li>1 pound ground sirloin</li>
        <li>Sea Salt</li>
        <li>Freshly cracked black pepper</li>
        <li>Brioche burger buns</li>
        <li>1/3 cup yellow mustard</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>8 slices American cheese</li>
        <li>Tomato slices (1/4-inch-thick)</li>
        <li>Red onion slices (1/4-inch-thick)</li>
        <li>Pickle slices</li>
        <li>Lettuce</li>
        <li>Mayo</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Step 1</strong> <p>In a large bowl, combine the ground chuck and sirloin and mix gently but thoroughly. Divide into eight equal portions and shape them into burger patties. Season both sides with salt and pepper and refrigerate for 30 minutes.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Step 2</strong> <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Step 3</strong> <p>Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Split and toast the buns in the pan until toast and golden brown. Set aside.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Step 4</strong> <p>Remove the burgers from the fridge and place a thumbprint in the center of each patty. Smear 1 teaspoon of mustard on both sides of each patty. Melt the butter in the preheated pan and, working in bathces, fry the burgers for 3 to 4 minutes on each side, until a dark brown crust begins to form.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Step 5</strong> <p>Transfer the patties to a baking sheet as they're done. Top each patty with cheese and place in the oven to melt, 2 to 3 minutes.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Step 6</strong> <p>Build the burgers on the toasted buns with 1 or 2 burger patties, a slice of tomato, pickles, a slice of red onion, and lettuce. Top each with ketchup or mayo. Or both. Serve immediately.</p></li>
    </ul>
