    <h2>About this recipe</h2>
        <p>This Chocolate Chip Cookie recipe is one of the easiest. The cookies can be made from scratch in less than 20 minutes, and there's no need to get the mixer out or chill the dough. All of which make this the simplest chocolate chip cookie recipe.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Kosher Salt</li>
        <li>Chocolate Chips</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Step 1</strong> <p>You're going to start by melting the butter. The butter shouldn't be sizzling hot. If you're not sure how hot is too hot, you'll want it about 90% melted, and then you'll whisk it until it finishes melting.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Step 2</strong> <p>Once the butter has melted, whisk in the sugars until well-combined</p></li>
        <li><strong>Step 3</strong> <p>Mix in the vanilla extract and the egg.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Step 4</strong> <p>Add the flour, baking soda, and salt. Stir in just until combined. You don't want to overmix the dough.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Step 5</strong> <p>Stir in the chocolate chips, and then scoop the dough. Place about 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheet.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Step 6</strong> <p>Bake until the cookies are set on the edges but slightly underdone in the middle, about 7-10 minutes. Slightly under-baking the cookies helps to keep them soft.</p></li>
    </ul>
